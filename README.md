This is a sample project I am completing following the official [Django Docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/) as a way to learn the basics of Django.

The project creates a basic polling application. It has two parts:
* A public site that lets people view polls and vote on polls
* An admin set that lets you add, change, and delete polls
